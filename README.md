### Requirements:
+ [Node.js][1] - v14 or higher
+ [Google Firebase][2] - Configure database.

### Instructions to run the site:
**PLEASE NOTE:** In some steps, I have asked y'all to save some details or files for later.
You need to make sure that they are saved in a secure place.
**Do not** share them with anyone else and **do not** commit them to GitHub.

To run this site locally, follow these rules:
#### 1. Configure node:
+ Go to [nodejs竊余[1] site.
+ Download and install it for your pc.
+ Be sure to install v14 or higher.

#### 2. Configure your database:
+ Go to [firebase console竊余[2].
+ Setup a project with some basic settings.
+ Click on the settings icon in the right sidebar.
+ Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
+ Under the "Firebase Admin SDK", look for a "Generate new private key" button.
+ Download the json configuration file.

#### 3. Configure sentry:
+ Go to [sentry竊余(https://sentry.io/) and sign in.
+ Setup an express project following some basic instructions.
+ Save the sentry dsn url somewhere for later.

#### 4. Get a discord webhook:
+ We use Discord Webhooks to send all contact form data directly to your server.
+ If you want to opt out of this step, go to src/routers/contact.js and remove the Discord Webhook section.
+ You would need to use the **desktop version** of discord to manage webhooks.
+ Go to [Discord](https://discord.com/) and sign in.
+ Go to a server where you have *MANAGE_WEBHOOKS* permission, or create your own server.
+ Create a channel > Go to channel settings > Webhooks and create a webhook.
+ Name the webhook whatever you want and you can also optionally provide an image.
+ Copy the webhook link and save it somewhere for later.

*Note: You can replace the /api/webhooks/ with /api/v7/webhooks to get more descriptive errors while testing new features.*
